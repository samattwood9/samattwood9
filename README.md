Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sam - a researcher and developer working in the UK. I'm interested in using **natural language processing** to tap into the potential of **grey literature**. To be specific, I'm interested in tapping into the potential of grey literature related to **software engineering**, and ultimately providing tooling to help others do the same. Alongside my research, I frequently work with small-to-medium sized organisations and help them to understand what they can achieve using **artificial intelligence**.
