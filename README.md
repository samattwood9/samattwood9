Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sam - a researcher working in the UK. I'm interested in using **natural language processing** to tap into the potential of **grey literature**/**grey material** related to **secure software engineering**, and ultimately providing tooling to help others do the same. Alongside my research, I frequently work with individual learners and organisations and help them build their **advanced digital skills**.
